                    Just one hour from Dublin Airport and an hour and half from Shannon
                    Airport, connected by Mainline rail and Motorway networks, getting
                    to Laois is a safe and easy journey. Once here there is so much to
                    do in the bustling county town of Portlaoise. Stay in one of the
                    4-star hotels in the town. If you prefer a guest house or B&B a
                    number of high quality homes also await you. Wherever you choose you
                    can be assured of a warm welcome and the best of hospitality.
                    Portlaoise was the first planted town with a British Fort built
                    between 1547 and 1548 during the tenure of Bellingham, Lord Justice
                    of Ireland, in the reign of “the boy King” Edward V. The town grew
                    up around the Fort walls from the 1560s and was renamed Maryborough
                    in honor of Queen Mary. The local tribes of the day were formidable
                    and the woodlands, lakes and location of Laois and Portlaoise were
                    seen as strategically important to control. The medieval history of
                    the town can be explored by following the Portlaoise Heritage Trail.

                            It's not a big city so for me so it became the best way to meet
                            new people. The itinerary always changes and sometimes we can
                            attend concerts with a discount. I recommend!

                            places and found this Pubcrawl. I went on both available tours
                            and I can say that I will be back. Very helpful and friendly
