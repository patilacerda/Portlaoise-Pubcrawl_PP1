                Portlaoise was the first planted town with a British Fort built between 1547 and 1548 during the tenure
                of Bellingham, Lord Justice of Ireland, in the reign of “the boy King” Edward V. The town grew up around
                the Fort walls from the 1560’s and was renamed Maryborough in honor of Queen Mary. The local tribes of
                the day were formidable and the woodlands, lakes and location of Laois and Portlaoise were seen as
                strategically important to control. The medieval history of the town can be explored by following the
                Portlaoise Heritage Trail.
